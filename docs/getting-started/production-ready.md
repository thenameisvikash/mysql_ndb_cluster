## Hardware Recommendations

### Compute Resources

| Component | CPU | RAM | Disk |
|-----------|-----|-----|------|
| Management Node | 2-4 cores | 4-8GB | 20GB SSD |
| Data Node | 8-16 cores | 32-64GB | 100GB+ SSD |
| MySQL Node | 8-16 cores | 16-32GB | 100GB+ SSD |
| ProxySQL | 4-8 cores | 8-16GB | 50GB SSD |

### Network Requirements

- **Latency**: <1ms between nodes in the same data center
- **Bandwidth**: 1Gbps+ for all nodes
- **Dedicated Network**: Separate network for cluster communication

### Storage Recommendations

- **Data Nodes**: High-performance SSDs with low latency
- **MySQL Nodes**: SSDs for system and data files
- **Backup Storage**: Separate storage for backups

## Security Hardening

### Network Security

1. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Allow only necessary ports
   - Restrict access to management interfaces
   - Use security groups or network ACLs

2. **Network Isolation**:
   - Use private networks for cluster communication
   - Place ProxySQL in a DMZ if public access is required
   - Use VLANs or subnets to isolate components

### Authentication and Authorization

1. **Strong Passwords**:
   - Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
   - Store passwords securely (e.g., in a password manager or vault)
   - Rotate passwords regularly

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Create application-specific users with minimal permissions
   - Restrict administrative access
   - Use read-only users for reporting and analytics

### Encryption

1. **Transport Encryption**:
   - Enable TLS/SSL for all connections
   - Use strong cipher suites
   - Validate certificates

2. **Data at Rest Encryption**:
   - Enable tablespace encryption
   - Secure backup files

## High Availability Configuration

### Multiple Data Centers

For critical deployments, consider a multi-data center setup:

1. **Active-Active Configuration**:
   - Deploy node groups in different data centers
   - Configure synchronous replication between data centers
   - Use GeoDNS or global load balancers for client connections

2. **Active-Passive Configuration**:
   - Deploy a primary cluster in one data center
   - Deploy a secondary cluster in another data center
   - Configure asynchronous replication between clusters
   - Set up automated failover procedures

### Load Balancing

1. **ProxySQL Configuration**:
   - Deploy multiple ProxySQL instances
   - Configure connection pooling appropriately
   - Optimize query routing rules
   - Set up health checks and monitoring

2. **External Load Balancer**:
   - Consider using an external load balancer (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX, AWS ALB)
   - Configure health checks and failover
   - Set up SSL termination if needed

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Cluster Health**:
   - Node status
   - Replication status
   - Connection status

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Query throughput
   - Query latency
   - Connection count
   - Memory usage
   - Disk usage
   - CPU usage

3. **Error Rates**:
   - Failed queries
   - Failed connections
   - Replication errors

### Monitoring Tools

1. **Prometheus and Grafana**:
   - Set up Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Configure Grafana dashboards for visualization
   - Set up alerting rules

2. **MySQL Enterprise Monitor**:
   - Consider using MySQL Enterprise Monitor for comprehensive monitoring
   - Configure advisors and alerts

3. **Custom Monitoring**:
   - Use the included monitoring scripts
   - Schedule regular health checks
   - Set up log monitoring

### Alerting Configuration

1. **Alert Thresholds**:
   - Set appropriate thresholds for alerts
   - Configure different severity levels
   - Avoid alert fatigue

2. **Notification Channels**:
   - Email
   - SMS
   - Slack/Teams
   - PagerDuty or similar service

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy

1. **Regular Backups**:
   - Schedule daily full backups
   - Enable binary logging for point-in-time recovery
   - Store backups in multiple locations

2. **Backup Verification**:
   - Regularly verify backup integrity
   - Test restoration procedures
   - Document recovery time

### Disaster Recovery

1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**:
   - Define how quickly you need to recover
   - Test recovery procedures to ensure RTO can be met

2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**:
   - Define acceptable data loss
   - Configure backup frequency to meet RPO

3. **Disaster Recovery Plan**:
   - Document detailed recovery procedures
   - Assign roles and responsibilities
   - Conduct regular drills

## Performance Optimization

### MySQL Configuration

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Optimize `DataMemory` and `IndexMemory` based on dataset size
   - Configure `MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations` and `MaxNoOfConcurrentTransactions` appropriately
   - Adjust `thread_cache_size` and `table_open_cache`

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Create appropriate indexes
   - Optimize query patterns
   - Use prepared statements

### ProxySQL Optimization
